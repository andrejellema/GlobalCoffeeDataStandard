Welcome to Global Coffee Data Standard's documentation!
=======================================================

This project displays the initial basic Indicators for farm-level coffee sustainability, as originally determined by the GCP and the SPF Indicator Working Group. COSA–with feedback from the members of the Global Expert Committee–developed and synthesized practical metrics to operationalize the indicators so they can be functional across origins and comparable over time.
